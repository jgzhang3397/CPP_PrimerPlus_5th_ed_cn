 * @brief 
 * 
 * @param c 
 * @param n 
 * @return char* 
 * To create a string of n visible characters,
 * you needs to rage for n + 1 characters in order to have space for the null character.
 * So the function in Listing7.10 asks for n + 1 bytes to hold the string. 
 * Next, it sets the final byte to the null character. 
 * Then, it fills in the rest of the array from back to front.
 * 
 * The reason for filling the string from back to front instead of front to back
 * is to avoid using an additional variable.
