 * 3. Write a precursor to a menu-driven program.
 * The program should display a menu offering four choices, each labeled with a letter.
 * If the user responds with a letter other than one of the four valid choices, 
 * the program should prompt the user to enter a valid response until the user complies.
 * Then the program should use a switch to select a sim- ple action based on the userâ€™s selection. 
 * A program run could look something like this: 
 * 
 * Please enter one of the following choices:
        c) carnivore    p) pianist
        t) tree         g) game
        q) quit
        Please enter a c, p, t, or g: q
        Please enter a c, p, t, or g: t
        A maple is a tree.
