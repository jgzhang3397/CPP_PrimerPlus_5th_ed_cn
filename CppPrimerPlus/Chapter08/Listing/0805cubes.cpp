 * the refcube() function modifies the value of x in main() and cube() doesnâ€™t.
 * The variable a is local to cube(). It is initialzed to the value of x, 
 * but changing a has no effect on x. 
 * But because refcube() uses a reference argument, 
 * the changes it makes to ra are actually made to x.
 * 
 * Reference arguments become useful with larger data units, such as structures and classes
